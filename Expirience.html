<h4> <center> <b>Vice-President and Co-Founder of robotics program at Excelsior academy

 </b>  </Center> </h4>

<p> Starting off as a rookie team and starting late, preparing for the annual robotics competition was difficult. As a team we rigorously worked to make sure we had everything appropriately in place to compete in the competition. As a leader, I was presented with setting a clear vision for the members of the club, motivating and guiding members to a common goal.  Fall of 2014- Fall of 2016

 <h4> <center> <b> Project manager of Slavery Awareness Project
 </b>  </Center> </h4>

<p>As a school we were split into a few groups each tasked with different activities to inform the public of modern day slavery. Choosing to make a website using HTML/CSS was a difficult task we were excited to take on. As one of the leaders, I realized the importance in effective communication. This essential component was lost during the few month long project. Rushing to tie everything in place towards the end made the project ever-more challenging. Reflecting on this experience later on taught me the importance of effective communication.   September of 2015- February of 2016   </p>

<h4> <center> <b> Part of student advisory board for Global To Local


 </b>  </Center> </h4>

<p>	 As a club we are dedicated in serving the community of Newburgh to better help it thrive as a whole. We plan to go to Quito Ecuador in the summer of 2017 to volunteer at an afterschool program assisting children. Hoping to learn different skills while there, we plan to apply them in Newburgh leading projects addressing problems in Newburgh. We are currently involved in fundraising for the trip and strengthening our voice to the public.   September of 2016- Present

<h4> <center> <b> One of the Founders of Excelsior Awareness Committee

 </b>  </Center> </h4>

<p>	This committee stems from our interest to inform the public about modern day slavery. To continue our efforts, we decided to set out to different middle schools informing them about the topic and how they can help, even at a young age. February of 2016- June of 2016

  <h4> <center> <b> Employee At Newburgh Unity Center

   </b>  </Center> </h4>

<p>	Opening a new program at the community center teaching students grades 2-8  about computer science drew attention to fellow colleagues interested in teaching at the program. I competed for 1 of 8 openings against 20 fellow peers and was awarded one of the jobs at the center. There, we teach different computer science platforms including Scratch, Dash and Dots, and Lego Mindstorms. September of 2016- Present

<h4> <center> <b> Public Speaking- Fall of 2014

 </b>  </Center> </h4>

 <p> I had the opportunity to speak in front of an audience about a topic that I was concerned with. With my efforts to save water, my speech involved the danger of wasting water and how it we can help to prevent this.  Although this experience was a little nerve-racking, I learned how time and effort pays off in front of a crowd.

<h4> <center> <b> Public Speaking- Fall of 2015

 </b>  </Center> </h4>

 <p>Having the same opportunity the next year, I choose a topic that will directly effect my peers and I. The technology policy implemented in our school doesn't make sense and can be change. Excelling at my speech, I was asked to persuade the Board Of Education to change the Policy.
